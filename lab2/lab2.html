          <h3>General Information</h3>
          <p>Hi! My name is Phoebe Manuel. I'm a senior at UAB, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Aerospace Studies. I am also an Air Force ROTC cadet at Samford. My plan is to graduate and commission as an Intelligence Officer in May of 2024.</p>

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>I enjoy reading and writing a lot. I have also gotten into cross stitch and embroidery. I'm always listening to music and curating different playlists. I have over 400 for very specific vibes :) .I love travel and everything associated with it. Learning about different cultures has always been something I've enjoyed.</p>
